## Dev Requirements

- Node and NPM
- hugo extended (0.134.3+)

## Creating content

All documentation lives in the `docs` folder.

`index.md` files in Hugo are special. They basically tell Hugo to not look for other files to process in sub-directories.

## Internal docs 

Under `/docs/internal/` a documentation for working with the docs can be found.
